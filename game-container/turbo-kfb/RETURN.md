Updated: 2026-09-29
Status: **CHECKPOINT B BROWSER PASS · HUMAN MOTION/FEEL GATE**

## Owner / branch / heads
- repo: `georg-doc/kayfabizarro`
- branch: `chatgpt-web/kfb-container-turbo-01-2026-09-29`
- tested runtime head: `b4c7bb14cb51d6c5515613593b33c0ea0e183e89`
- Ground implementation head: `772131720e591df1ca341a73e1a59284ef5dd499`
- upstream host donor: `bridge-mind/turbo-kart-rally@c52aca3f10c7995884c316810cac6514daa40e9c` · MIT

## Implemented
### EXPLORE
- one player kart;
- upstream Kart / Input / ChaseCamera feel retained;
- no countdown/laps/results requirement;
- Race ItemSystem off;
- Race remains regression control.

### WALK
- real ActionFigure · Rig_Medium;
- existing KFB `walk-controller.js` is sole Ground movement owner;
- one AnimationMixer for presentation;
- Root/Hips world translation stripped;
- exact clips:
  `Idle_A · Walking_A · Running_A · Jump_Start · Jump_Idle · Jump_Land`;
- KCL/Motion-Lab measured Walk/Run mapping and phase-sync logic consumed;
- hidden kart is not updated while Ground owns movement;
- Turbo ChaseCamera follows the Ground target interface.

**29/29 PASS**
- runtime errors: 0
- console/page errors: 0
- EXPLORE drive displacement: 28.91 u
- EXPLORE speed: 33.23 u/s
- Race regression: 8 karts, drive displacement 22.51 u
- Ground Walk: `Walking_A`
- Ground Run: `Running_A` at measured 2.480274... u/s
- Run → Walk → Idle transition PASS
- Jump: `Jump_Start → Jump_Idle → Jump_Land` PASS

## Recovery finding
Runs 5–7 were false-negative QA results caused by headless `requestAnimationFrame` advancing only about one fixed 1/30 s step during a 1.4 s wall-clock wait.

Run 7 proved input was already correct:
`throttle=1`, `controlsLocked=false`, speed `1.220266...`, displacement `0.04`.

The tested runtime adds a deterministic `advanceBy(seconds)` **QA seam only**. Kart/Ground gameplay tuning was not changed to make the test pass.

## Stage / Hub
Published source:
- `cloudflare-live@563d3c1f1c0ed89bf810ba7448db8e90bf0a30f3`
- Cloudflare Pages check: **SUCCESS**
- direct Stage: `https://kayfabizarro.pages.dev/kfb-hub/stage/game-container/turbo-01/`
- Hub card updated to `BROWSER 29/29 · HUMAN MOTION GATE`

The current ChatGPT web fetcher cannot open `pages.dev`, so independent in-chat `PUBLIC_VERIFIED` remains OPEN. No claim beyond successful deployment is made.

## Human gate
In the real Stage:
1. click **EXPLORE** briefly to confirm Turbo driving still feels like the donor;
2. return to title, click **WALK**;
3. try W, Shift+W, stop, A/D turns and Space.

Judge only:
- foot sliding;
- Walk/Run transition weight;
- facing/camera;
- Jump/Land feel.

## Deferred
Cards · Residents · Enter/Exit Kart · Voxel/WFC world · Clay look · Flight.

## Exactly one next gate
**Georg motion/feel review of the integrated Stage.**
If this is a PROCEED PASS, next implementation is Checkpoint C: `WALK ⇄ ENTER KART ⇄ DRIVE ⇄ EXIT ⇄ WALK`.
